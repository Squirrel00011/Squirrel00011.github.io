Hi! I am a graduate student currently pursuing my research interests in the field of computer vision at Xidian University. My academic journey began here as an undergraduate, and I have since dedicated myself to the fascinating world of image generation tasks and computer vision.

## My work and research
My research primarily revolves around image synthesis. With a strong foundation in deep learning, I strive to develop innovative solutions to complex challenges within computer vision. I am particularly enthusiastic about enhancing the quality and diversity of generated images and their applications across various domains.

## My background and history
- I am currently pursuing my Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in [Computer Science](insert link) at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn).
- I completed my undergraduate studies in [Computer Science](insert link) at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn).
